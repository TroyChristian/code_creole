##Code Creole 
Code Creole is a technology blog that aims to make learning about technology more accessible in the Haitian Creole language. This is a work in progress that will eventually incorporate an accompanying mobile application and user submitted content.  These features are under active development. 

For now we use AI to power translations and content generation (All content generated as AI is clearly marked so that future models are not trained on it.)
